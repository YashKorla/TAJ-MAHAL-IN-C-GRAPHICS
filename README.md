# TAJ-MAHAL-IN-C-GRAPHICS
This code prints the Taj Mahal using Graphics in C.

I have used simple graphical functions like line, rectangle, circle, ellipse to get the desired output. I have also used delay functions after all specific parts to get a good visual of the formation of the Taj Mahal.

Thank You for using my code.
